we present partial code snippets illustrating the design of three distinct forms of matched NMR data and the corresponding network structures employed in our research. The required software includes MATLAB and a Python IDE (PyCharm recommended). Our objective is to inspire readers to explore similar methods for generating NMR data or other geophysical data.

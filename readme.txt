we present partial code snippets illustrating the design of three distinct forms of matched NMR data and the corresponding network structures employed in our research. The required software includes MATLAB and a Python IDE (PyCharm recommended). Our objective is to inspire readers to explore similar methods for generating NMR data or other geophysical data.

Please feel free to discuss and exchange ideas on topics related to NMR, ML, CCUS, and others. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. My email is gumingxuan_cup@163.com.
